## Allen Ram√≠rez Projects
I would like to utilize my computer science knowledge and skills in my future workplace as well as to grow as a professional, collaborating with others and learning more every day.  
  
### Educational Space Game Application in Hackathon
Oct 2022 - Oct 2022  
First place national winning team of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2022 hackathon.
Developed an educational mobile game using Java and Android Studio, employing genetic algorithms to simulate the evolution of organisms with space-adapted traits.
Implemented an interactive experience showcasing the bases of genetic algorithms and scientific exploration.
  
On October 1st and 2nd, 2022, I participated in the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2022 hackathon in the Adaptation Heroes team.  
Our group was the first place winner for Costa Rica being part of the global nominees for this event.
